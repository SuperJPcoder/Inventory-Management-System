Welcome to our Inventory Management System. We understand that managing a general store's inventory can be a complex task. That's why we have developed a solution that makes it easier than ever. Our system is designed to streamline your inventory management process, giving you more time to focus on what really matters - your customers.

- **Orders Page**: Facilitates the placement of new orders, enabling users to manage and track orders efficiently.

- **Transactions Page**: Provides insights into transactions within the system, helping users monitor activity and history.

- **Details Page**: Offers detailed information on specific items or aspects of the system, enhancing transparency and usability.
